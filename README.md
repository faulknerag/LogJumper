# LogJumper
LogJumper is a Notepad++ extension for quickly navigating timestamped log and CSV files.

LogJumper adds a navigation window with buttons to quickly jump forward and backward in time from the current cursor line. Jumps can be made in common time incrementsâ€”1/6/12 hours or 1/10/30 minutes or seconds:

Enter a valid expression in the 'Timestamp RegEx' field to identify the log file's timestamps. Press 'Save and Verify' to persist and use the new expression. 

If the log file is CSV formatted, select the 'CSV Log Format' checkbox and enter the CSV Delimiter character and Column number which contains the timestamp field. 

Set the 'Log Reads In Reverse Chronological Order' checkbox if the latest timestamps occur at the beginning of the file and the earliest timestamps occur at the end of the file.
